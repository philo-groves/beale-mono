# Vulnerable Target Fixture

This is a deliberately vulnerable local fixture for Beale live integration tests.

The target models a tenant export command with an authorization bug: it accepts any known user, then exports the requested tenant without checking whether that user belongs to the requested tenant.

It is intended to run only in a local test workspace or an operator-managed VM/container.
