## Status

**Very early stage / pre-alpha.**

This project is still under heavy development. There is a lot left to do before it's ready for real use. I wouldn't recommend trying to use the agent yet — it's more of a workbench-in-progress than a polished tool.

If you're curious about the direction or want to follow along, you're welcome to explore the repo. Feedback and ideas are appreciated, but expect things to be incomplete, unstable, and subject to frequent change.

## What is Beale?

Beale is a specialized research environment designed to help security researchers explore, hypothesize about, and verify vulnerabilities in **authorized targets only**.

It combines:
- A structured, auditable workbench for mapping architecture, trust boundaries, and attack surfaces
- Honeycrisp-driven reasoning and discovery loops
- Strong emphasis on reproducible observations, provenance, and responsible disclosure
- Honeycrisp-backed execution, memory, trace, context, and artifact visibility

The guiding philosophy is **human-steered, verifiable research** rather than fully autonomous scanning or benchmark chasing.

### Core Principles
- **Authorization first** — everything stays within the operator-recorded authorized scope
- **References over unsupported claims** — durable conclusions should point to observable tool results, files, commands, or artifacts
- **Traceability** — full append-only audit trail of sessions, tool calls, observations, artifacts, and verifier outcomes
- **Operator-controlled isolation** — Beale/Honeycrisp run with the user's host privileges; launch them inside your own VM or container when isolation is required
- **Human in the loop** — steering, review, Honeycrisp memory validation, and patch checking remain researcher-driven

---

## Key Concepts

- **Workspaces**: Local authorized research contexts with explicit ownership in Honeycrisp's global SQLite database, Beale artifacts, and references to relevant source material
- **Research Kits**: Immutable workspace-creation configurations that acquire initial resources, scope, and rules for specialized research programs
- **Runs / Sessions**: Research sessions with steering and agent forking
- **Trace, Memory & Runbooks**: Timeline of model and tool activity beside durable research knowledge and revisioned executable procedures
- **Tools**: Honeycrisp tools, skills, MCP servers, and Beale-owned disclosure/export affordances
- **Harness**: Trusted Electron main process manages credentials, policy, persistence, and coordination

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

- **Trusted Host** (Electron main): Credentials, authorized-scope policy, artifact acceptance, and typed access to Honeycrisp's versioned client protocol
- **Renderer UI**: React + TypeScript interface for visualization and interaction
- **Execution Posture**: Honeycrisp runs as a host process. Beale does not create or manage a VM/container sandbox.
- **Agent Integration**: Honeycrisp launches as the research engine; Beale displays workspace-scoped traces, durable knowledge, context, and artifacts from the active research-profile database

---

## Current State

- Electron + Vite + TypeScript foundation
- User-global registry of local Beale workspaces
- Honeycrisp-owned global SQLite persistence under `~/.honeycrisp/memory.sqlite`, with workspace and research-profile ownership retained on records
- A canonical research-claim ledger with one stable identity from Lead to Finding, append-only evidence-gated transitions, independent verification, source/environment staleness, profile classifications, composite claims, and durable runbook/report/disclosure references
- A workspace Campaign graph that maps authorized assets through research memory and findings to proof/report artifacts, ranks uncovered territory and contradictions, and seeds focused follow-up runs
- Honeycrisp-backed research session execution
- Workspace-local Cybersecurity and Mathematics research profiles with profile-specific sessions, memory, workflows, prompts, collaboration recipes, and catalogs
- Durable research-subject identity that is independent of the recorded authorization owner
- Workspace-lifetime research Channels with durable transcripts and subagent results, cross-session reuse, non-blocking multi-provider participation, and explicit deletion
- Selectable Simple and Advanced subagent modes: Simple retains direct delegation and messaging, while Advanced runs a rolling lead-owned exploration and verification evidence team with independent worker lanes, bounded active capacity, replacement work, and coordinator checkpoints
- Honeycrisp-owned workspace housekeeping with separate Dejunk and Dream maintenance: Dejunk organizes recognizable loose research material under `research/` and reclaims large rebuildable or extracted resources outside protected Beale metadata and detected repositories
- Same-session provider failure recovery with capped retry backoff and transcript-aware safety-guardrail steering
- Trace UI with model, tool, system, user-steering, memory-producing, and compaction events
- Host integration for the separately maintained Beale-iOS ScreenCaptureKit companion over a loopback-only USB tunnel; selecting a research session prepares an authenticated channel for a physically connected iPhone, while the operator opens the companion and approves capture on the device. Live pixels fit into the lower-right space below the compact summary and can expand to fill the detailed sidenav while navigating other iPhone apps
- A client-neutral app-server control plane for Desktop, Beale-iOS, and future clients exposes path-free workspace summaries plus bounded canonical memory and session reads. The standalone app-server can bind the host's Tailscale IPv4 address; tailnet connectivity and ACLs remain the operator-managed authorization boundary
- Session transcripts persisted separately from trace metadata
- List-only Honeycrisp memory catalog with search, session/workspace/subject scope and type filters, inline details, references, and textual relationships
- Workspace-scoped Jupyter-format runbooks with whole-run, inclusive range, and per-cell controls; independent content-revision, completed-run, executed-cell, and latest-status metrics; durable cell results; bounded outputs; healthy-runbook guidance; and dedicated Honeycrisp tools and Beale sidebar visibility
- First-class workspace Reports with a dedicated sidenav catalog, revision/state visibility, on-demand report-focused agent chats, and inline section change requests routed through normal session commentary and tool traces; opening a report stays idle until the user sends a request, with report artifact details supplied as agent context
- Steering for active sessions
- Codex, Anthropic (Claude), and xAI (Grok/X) provider onboarding/status UI
- Opt-in local profiling that writes structured JSONL reports
- No public releases yet

### Honeycrisp Boundary

Beale uses Honeycrisp's user-global `~/.honeycrisp/memory.sqlite` database. Operational sessions, runbook metadata, and durable knowledge retain explicit workspace, subject, and research-profile ownership, so profile selection remains workspace-local without clearing or hiding other workspaces. Session metadata, transcript/trace cursor pages, collaboration state, capture metadata, and requested event detail cross the Honeycrisp boundary as separate bounded responses. Capture rows reference normalized durable event streams instead of embedding duplicate timelines, routine event appends do not re-read or rewrite prior history, and legacy aggregate documents migrate transactionally. Structural database corruption and session hash failures remain non-retryable and instruct the operator to stop writers and preserve the original database before restore or repair. Every terminal session records a structured final disposition with typed blocker dependencies and an explicit indication of whether external state is required before meaningful progress can continue. Durable knowledge is a small graph of concise typed nodes, relationships, tags, and evidence references; transcripts, task narration, and bulk outputs are not memory. Runbooks are workspace-scoped `.ipynb` artifacts for reusable procedures and proof sequences. Their whole-run, inclusive cell-range, and per-cell controls execute only in the owning live Honeycrisp session, through the normal shell-safety boundary; each cell retains its latest status, duration, exit code, and bounded output. Content revisions are reported separately from completed runs and executed cells, so execution-state persistence is not presented as authoring activity.

For active runs, Beale sends only logical session intent to the Beale app-server. The server resolves workspace identity, host paths, storage, provider policy, plugins, capture/continuation files, and canonical profile snapshots before hosting Honeycrisp in an isolated worker. Worker events and controls use direct messages; only the client-facing app-server WebSocket remains. Desktop authenticates with a per-session bearer token, consumes the shared event stream, and reads bounded canonical state through the same control plane. Canonical operations use the authenticated app-server operation endpoint rather than spawning Honeycrisp commands.

Honeycrisp protocol v1 is the transport boundary, while contract v6 identifies the executing runtime build, claim-ledger and security-tracking schema versions, and required capabilities. Beale validates the app-server descriptor and WebSocket hello. Session persistence and queries, claims, campaign projection, knowledge and artifact operations, auxiliary model jobs and provider semantics, Agent Plugins, source materialization, and Dejunk maintenance are Honeycrisp-owned operations hosted by app-server.

Beale is pre-alpha and uses append-only component-scoped migrations.

The sidebar Skills and MCP Servers views request hosted tool discovery and configuration from app-server, so persisted skill directories, selected skill ids, MCP config paths, allowlists, and timeouts remain in Honeycrisp's `.honeycrisp/tools.json`. Legacy synchronous Desktop call sites may use the packaged app-server client, but that executable cannot host research or access Honeycrisp storage directly.

### Research Profiles

Beale uses Honeycrisp's bundled Cybersecurity profile by default. Each workspace selects Cybersecurity or Mathematics during creation, stores that selection in the workspace registry, and can use the shared global database without changing another workspace's active profile or clearing workspace lists.

The Mathematics profile keeps reusable problems, definitions, techniques, references, and trajectories in knowledge memory while defining conjecture, theorem, and counterexample as claim classifications. Its workflows cover open exploration, proof development, verification, and literature synthesis. The Cybersecurity profile similarly classifies isolated and composite findings as `security.primitive` and `security.chain` while keeping reusable system knowledge separate. Collaboration recipes remain profile- and workflow-specific.

Before each new run, Beale asks Honeycrisp to resolve and normalize the selected bundled profile, verifies its content hash, and stores the exact snapshot in that profile's database. The run references that snapshot, and continuations, capture import, historical rendering, and memory interpretation reuse it.

### Research Kits

Each workspace also selects a Research Kit during creation. General leaves resource and authorization entry manual; HackerOne imports and normalizes a public program scope; Apple Security Bounty supplies program guidance and an optional Apple OSS repository catalog; Google OSS VRP supplies Google Bug Hunters rules and the published tiered OT0/OT1 repository catalog; and MSRC supplies program guidance and rules. Kit definitions declare their compatible Research Profiles and acquisition capabilities in one shared catalog. The selection is persisted with the workspace and shown read-only in Workspace Overview because changing it after creation could invalidate the recorded scope, resources, and rules.

A profile describes requested defaults; it does not grant authority. Beale remains the trusted host for provider credentials, enabled tool families, side effects, skills, MCP servers, shell policy, and recorded authorization. Workspace profile defaults are constrained by those host-owned settings. In particular, Beale always supplies its own Auto-Review model map and reasoning effort; a profile's `modelJobs.shellReview` route cannot influence shell authorization.

Auto-Review receives only compact host facts about recorded authorization, operator-managed execution posture, and trusted runbook execution identity when present. It classifies proofing separately and denies proof commands that do not originate from a recorded runbook cell. If it denies an otherwise reviewable non-policy command, the affected session replaces its steering composer with a correlated Approve Once question; the researcher can approve only that exact command or keep it blocked. A malformed reviewer response receives one bounded schema-repair retry. Policy failures and unavailable or malformed reviews remain fail-closed, while Beale retains only the sanitized failure category, phase, and attempt count.

Beale includes an optional built-in `beale-terminator` Agent Plugin for Windows computer use. It is installed but disabled by default in Plugins and uses the exactly pinned MIT-licensed Terminator 0.24.32 UI Automation SDK. The plugin exposes only observe, find, click, type, key, scroll, wait, and screenshot operations; it does not expose Terminator's shell, browser-script, application-launch, filesystem, registry, process-control, or general workflow APIs. Read-only observations run directly, while every UI mutation pauses for a correlated Approve Once decision in Beale. Mutation targets require a fresh, 30-second, single-use observation ID and are re-resolved and fingerprinted after approval. Terminal, credential, authentication, password-manager, Windows security, permission, CAPTCHA, age-verification, ChatGPT, Codex, and Beale surfaces are denied. Computer use still runs with the current user's desktop privileges and is not isolation.

Beale's default profile delegation ceiling permits the `shell`, `repository-search`, and `file-read` families and the `none`, `read`, `write`, and `process` effects. Repository search and file reads use the current user's host filesystem permissions and may read paths outside the Beale workspace; configured repositories remain context hints rather than access fences. A trusted host operator can replace the allowed built-in families with `BEALE_HONEYCRISP_PROFILE_TOOL_FAMILY_CEILING_JSON` or narrow those effects with `BEALE_HONEYCRISP_PROFILE_SIDE_EFFECT_CEILING_JSON`. These JSON arrays are host configuration, not profile fields. Beale-launched Honeycrisp sessions are granted the shell network side effect uniformly; network isolation and destination control must be enforced outside the application with operator-managed VM, container, firewall, proxy, or host controls.

See `CHANGELOG.md` and `AGENTS.md` for current product changes and development rules.

### Known Incomplete Surfaces

- Scheduled research is not a product flow.
- Export, disclosure draft, and redacted trace review are incomplete.
- Full pause/resume/stop/fork/restart run controls are incomplete.
- Full verifier contract, artifact review, and artifact bundle controls are incomplete.
- Settings coverage is still narrow.

## Execution Notes

Beale does not create a managed execution sandbox. Honeycrisp runs with the current user's host privileges and persists durable artifacts through its storage/memory layout. If a research target needs OS isolation, launch Beale and Honeycrisp inside the VM, container, or lab environment you want to use.

Each research session has a shell safety mode in the steering composer. Auto-Review is the default and asks the active provider's assigned small model to review every normalized shell command before execution. Manual Approval waits for the researcher to approve or deny every command, while Danger Mode skips per-command review. `shell.run` accepts complete platform shell commands or direct executable-plus-argv calls, including executable paths, and inherits host HOME-family environment variables. Manual Approval denies commands with non-empty stdin, oversized command tuples, or executable fields that require redaction instead of presenting an incomplete or altered command for approval. All three modes retain Honeycrisp's remaining hard shell guards; none provides process isolation or reduces the privileges of commands that are allowed to run.

---

## Model Provider Notes

Codex remains the default. Honeycrisp's Pi runtime also supports Anthropic and xAI through subscription OAuth in Settings > Providers or through `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `XAI_API_KEY` in Beale's host environment. With the bundled security profile, Beale preloads four model-generated goals for each of Discovery, Chaining, and Reporting from bounded prior workspace research, using independent concurrent requests with per-section retry. Custom profiles can replace those workflows, instructions, labels, and suggestion counts. New Research presents the configured workflows in a sliding bottom sheet and expands a selected or custom goal into a full editable prompt. The sheet reads the installed Pi catalog and presents provider-specific model and reasoning-effort dropdowns, so run availability stays aligned with the Honeycrisp runtime rather than a duplicated Beale list.

Provider credentials stay in the trusted host runtime and are not copied into model-visible context, traces, or the global database.
